# Overview

RTRWH/AR is a comprehensive rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge assistant web application designed specifically for Indian conditions. The application helps homeowners and communities calculate rainwater harvesting potential, design appropriate storage systems, evaluate artificial recharge feasibility, and perform cost-benefit analysis. Built with scientific methodologies following Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) guidelines, it incorporates region-specific rainfall data, soil characteristics, and groundwater conditions to provide accurate recommendations tailored to Indian climate patterns.

The application features a multi-step user journey: landing page education, calculation type selection (rainwater harvesting or artificial recharge), comprehensive data input forms, and detailed results with feasibility analysis, cost breakdowns, and downloadable reports.
